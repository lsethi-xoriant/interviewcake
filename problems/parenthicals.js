/*
 * I like parentheticals (a lot).
 * "Sometimes (when I nest them (my parentheticals) too much (like this (and this))) they get confusing."
 *
 * Write a function that, given a sentence like the above, along with the position of an opening parenthesis, 
 * finds the corresponding closing parenthesis.
 *
 * Example: 
 * if the example string above is input with the number 10 (position of the first parenthesis), 
 * the output should be 79 (position of the last parenthesis).
 *
 * Gotchas
 * We can do this in O(n) time.

/*
 * Breakdown
 * How would you solve this problem by hand with an example input?
 *
 * Try looping through the string, keeping a count of how many open parentheses we have.
