/* 
 * Write an extended stack class that has a function getLargest() for returning the largest element in the stack.

var getLargest = function ( ) {
  // do stuff
};


























































/*
 * Breakdown
 * One lazy â†´ approach is to have getLargest() simply walk through the stack and find the largest element. 
 * This takes O(n) time for each call to getLargest(), and push() and pop() can be O(1). But we can do better.
 * 
 * To get O(1) time for getLargest(), we could store our largest as a member variable (call it largest). 
 * But how would we keep it up to date?
 * 
 * For every push(), we can check to see if the item being pushed is larger than the current largest, assigning it as our new largest if so. 
 * But what happens when we pop() the current largest? We could re-compute the current largest by walking through our stack in O(n) time. 
 * So our worst-case runtime for pop() would be O(n). We can do better.
 * 
 * What if when we find a new current largest (new_largest), instead of overwriting the old one (old_largest) we held onto it, 
 * so that once new_largest was popped off our stack we would know that our largest was back to old_largest?
 *
 * What data structure should we store our set of "largests" in? 
 * We want something where the last item we put in is the first item we get out ("last in, first out").
 *
 * We can store our list of "largests" in a stack!
